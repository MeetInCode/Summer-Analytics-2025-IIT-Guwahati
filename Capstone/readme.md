# Dynamic Parking Pricing System

A real-time intelligent parking pricing system that dynamically adjusts parking fees based on demand, occupancy, traffic conditions, and other contextual factors. Built with Pathway for real-time data processing and advanced machine learning models for optimal pricing strategies.

## 🚗 Project Overview

This system implements three sophisticated pricing models to optimize parking lot revenue while maintaining fair pricing for users. The system processes real-time parking data streams and adjusts prices dynamically based on:

- **Occupancy rates** and capacity utilization
- **Queue lengths** and waiting times
- **Traffic conditions** in surrounding areas
- **Special events** and peak demand periods
- **Vehicle types** and their parking requirements

The solution demonstrates how modern streaming data processing can be applied to urban infrastructure management, providing a scalable foundation for smart city initiatives.

## 📊 Architecture Components

### **1. Data Ingestion Layer**

- **Real-time Streaming**: Processes parking sensor data, traffic conditions, and external events
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data quality and type safety using Pathway schemas
- **Rate Control**: Manages data flow rates to prevent system overload

### **2. Pricing Models Engine**

#### **Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing**

```python
Price_t+1 = Price_t + α × (Occupancy/Capacity)
```

- Simple occupancy-based pricing adjustment
- Bounded between 50%-200% of base price
- Provides stable baseline for comparison

#### **Model 2: Advanced Demand-Based Pricing**

```python
Demand = α×Occupancy + β×Queue - γ×Traffic + δ×SpecialDay + ε×VehicleType
Price = BasePrice × (1 + λ × tanh(Demand))
```

- Multi-factor demand calculation
- Considers queue length, traffic conditions, special events
- Vehicle-type specific pricing adjustments

#### **Model 3: Competitive Pricing**

```python
CompetitivePrice = DemandPrice + ω × (AvgCompetitorPrice - DemandPrice)
```

- Location-aware pricing based on nearby parking lots
- Distance-weighted competitor analysis
- Strategic pricing for market positioning
